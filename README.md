# IMPORTANT: This project has been discontinued. Please go to the new Cocoon Cloud at http://cocoon.io. 
The new Cocoon cloud is completely Cordova based and has enhanced features that include: the most up to date Webview+, new Cocoon plugins, a better Developer App, support for any Cordova plugin and a revamped UI.

# CocoonJS Command Line tools #

The CocoonJS command line tools let you build Cordova-based applications that benefit of Ludei's services (like cloud project management) right in you terminal.

The CocoonJS CLI also provide access to the Webview+ execution environment. The CocoonJS CLI handles the installation and usage of the webview+ plugin directly in your computer.

> Ludei's WebView+ is a Chromium based solution for Android 4.0+ and the WKWebView for iOS 8.0+.

- [Webview+ for iOs](https://github.com/ludei/webview-plus-ios)
- [Webview+ for Android](https://github.com/ludei/webview-plus)

## Requirements ##
Install cordova-cli 3.2 or higher (Cordova 3.5 is recommended). Please refer to [Cordova prerequisites](https://github.com/apache/cordova-cli#requirements) to set up your environment.

After installing Cordova in your computer, execute the following command to install the CocoonJS CLI tools:

```
$ npm install -g cocoonjs
```

## How to use ##

Use any valid cordova command with the CocoonJS-CLI to manage your project, eg:

```
$ cocoonjs create MyProject com.ludei.test LudeiTest
$ cd MyProject
$ cocoonjs platform add android
$ cocoonjs plugin add com.ludei.webview.plus
$ cocoonjs run
```

#### Regarding cordova versions ####

The CocoonJS command line tool automatically detects the Cordova version installed in your computer. However, if you have multiple versions installed locally, you can explicitly point to a specific path using the --cordova-path argument to force that cordova binary to execute, eg:


```
$ cocoonjs platform add android --cordova-path=/Users/Cocoon/cordova/cordova-3.5.0-0.2.4/
```
Using the *--cordova-path*, the CocoonJS-CLI will find the cordova binary inside *cordova-3.5.0-0.2.4/bin/cordova* and will use it to spawn all the cordova-based commands. You can use any cordova 3.x version.


#### Troubleshooting ####

CocoonJS command line has a verbose mode. If you get any error, launch the command  with -d flag. And you'll get more info. For instance:

```
cocoonjs plugin add com.ludei.webview.plus -d
```

And post the info in the console attached to your issue.
